Five things I learned this semester

1. Text is my design tool. Event whough I tend to focus on the graphic part, text is as important as other elements.
2. Refreshed my presentation skills. Even if my language is not excellent, I know it is no problem for me.
3. Using GitHub and make some simple websites.
4. Cooperating with other people.
5. All the main new features in Affinity 2. And it is amazing!
