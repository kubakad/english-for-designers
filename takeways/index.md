Five things I learned this semester

1. Text is my design tool. Even though I tend to focus on the graphic part, the text is as important as other elements.
2. Refreshed my presentation skills; even if my language is not excellent, I know it is no problem for me.
3. Using GitHub and making some simple websites.
4. Collaborating with other people.
5. All the main new features in Affinity 2. And it is amazing!
