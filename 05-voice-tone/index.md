# Voice and tone

## Voice

I would like it to be a friendy and mostly real. I don't want to sound like some stereotypical machine that answers yes or no to your questions. I want to hear my clients and give them the best sollution for ther problems.

1. My voice is authentic
2. I'm friendly and confident
3. I shouldn't sound overly authoritative


## Tone

Depending on the project, I tend to change my tone. Whan the project is not as big and important as others, it's OK to be frindly and calm. But the more serious the project is, the more profesionall is my tone. I want the clients to feel that I take ther business seriously. But, if some suggestion doesn’t make sence, don’t be affraid to say it. They must be serious too.



1. Friendly
  - When aiming to new clients I want to be friendly and wellcoming. 

2. Authorative
  - I'm the graphic designer, it is my job and I know what I'm doing. The clients should know that their opinion is validated, but as I respect their job, they must respect mine.

3. Profesionall
  - Always try to give the best sollution.
  - There is no room for doubts, every major step must be explained and supported with facts.


## Style

I try to keep these things in mind when writing to stay as consistent as posible. Language is also my working tool.

**Clear language**
**Be specific** Always cut the fluff. Only write about important stuff.
**Be consistent** Apply the same cosistency that I applly to my work to language I write.
**Be patient** Be prepared that graphic design might be difficoult to understand to some people. Muset be resadz to give them space and time.
