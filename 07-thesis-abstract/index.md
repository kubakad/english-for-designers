This bachelor thesis deals with the issue of a communication and graphic manual for an already established company that has just started to do business in a completely new area. This area is the acquisition of smaller or medium-sized companies for the purpose of investment and subsequent appreciation. However, the graphic quality of the companies taken over in this way varies and in the vast majority is not up to the required standard. Often they do not even have any communication or marketing. The parent company therefore needs to unify the communication, visuals and overall appearance of the entire holding. The aim of the work is to unify the design, define rules for new acquisitions and reduce maintenance costs. The output itself is then a manual that clearly describes all of the above and shows examples.
